## Unit 24: Final Project

### Security+ Domains

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- **1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**
- **2.0 Architecture and Design** 
- **3.0 Implementation**
- **4.0 Operations and Incident Response**

### Scenario

You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate. <br>
You will start by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. <br>
You are to report back all your findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis. <br>

### Tasks
- [**Defensive Security**](Defensive/Defensive.md): Implement alerts and thresholds you determined would be effective in Project 2.
- [**Offensive Security**](Offensive/Offensive.md): Assess a vulnerable VM and verify that the Kibana rules work as expected.
- [**Network Forensics**](Network/Network.md): Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic on the wire.
