# Week 2: Assessing Security Culture 

## Security+ Domains
- This unit covered portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:
    - **5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance**

This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations.

For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses.
