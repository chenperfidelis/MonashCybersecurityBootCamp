   - An **incident** is a security event that compromises any of the CIA triad, i.e. Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability, of an information asset,
   - A **breach** is an incident which has resulted in the confirmed disclosure of data to one or more unauthorised parties.

2. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors? 
   - 69% perpetrated by outside actors
   - 34% perpetrated by internal actors

3. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized criminal groups?
   - Organized criminal groups were behind 39% of breaches

4. What percentage of breaches were financially motivated?
   - 71% of breaches were financially motivated

5. Define the following: 
   - **Denial of Service:** An attack aimed at disrupting the availability of a target by flooding the target with a large number of packets from one source, overwhelming the servers resources, resulting in a degradation of performance or completely inaccessible. Distributed Denial of Service differs by utilising many sources (multiple computers, or a botnet).
   - **Command and Control:** An infrastructure used to maintain a communication channel with compromised devices. Malwares on infected systems are able to communicate with attacker controlled command and control servers, allowing attackers to take command or exfiltrate information.
   - **Backdoor:** A malware which bypasses the normal authentication procedures, allowing remote access to the infected system.
   - **Keylogger:** A program designed to record the keystrokes of the affected system. Typically used to obtain passwords or encryption keys.

6. The time from an attacker’s first action to the initial compromise of an asset is typically measured in which one? Seconds, minutes, hours, days? 
   - The time from an attacker's first action to the initial compromise of an asset is typically measured in minutes. 

7. When it comes to phishing, which industry has the highest click rates?
   - The Education industry has the highest click rates when it comes to phishing.
