### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 

  ![Zenmap Scan](./Images/5.1.zenmap.png)
    ```
    nmap -T4 -A -v -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10
    ``` 
  - Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`: ``-oN zenmapscan.txt``
  
    ![Zenmap Scan with export](./Images/5.1.zenmap.zenmapscan.png)
- Zenmap vulnerability script command:
  
  ![Zenmap Script](./Images/5.1.zenmap.script.png)
- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
1. What is the vulnerability:
    - Samba 3.0.20
    - Anonymous users are able to read/write to `\\192.168.0.10\tmp` (`C:\tmp`)

2. Why is it dangerous:
    - Attackers would be able to write malicious files/codes to the folder to be executed

3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
    - Prevent read/write to directories by anonymous users
    - Updated to the latest version of SMB
    - Utilise a firewall to prevent access from unauthorised IP addresses
    - Block ports 139 and 445 from access via public IP addresses
    - Use a jumpbox to restricted access
